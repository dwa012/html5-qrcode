# HTML5 QR Code Reader

### Description

This is a cross platform jQuery library to create a QRcode reader for HTML5 compatible browser.

The decoder used for the QRcode reading is from LazarSoft
[https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode](https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode)

### Demo

See a demo here [https://dwa012.github.io/html5-qrcode/](https://dwa012.github.io/html5-qrcode/)


### Usage

Include:
- ```jQuery```
- The two supplied files in the lib directory; ```html5_qrcode.min.js```, and ```jsqrcode-combined.min.js```.

Create a basic ```<div>``` with a given width and height. 

Presently width and height attributes must be set. 
 
```
 <div id="reader" style="width:300px;height:250px">
 </div>
```

Then call the ```html5_qrcode``` function on the ```div```. 
 
```
 $('#reader').html5_qrcode(function(data){
 		 // do something when code is read
 	},
 	function(error){
		//show read errors 
	}, function(videoError){
		//the video stream could be opened
	}
);
```

It takes three callbacks: a ```readSuccess```, ```readError```, and ```videoLoadError```. The readError will be called quite often, it is really only useful for debugging. 

```videoError``` is called if the HTML5 video stream cannot be opened.


When you're done using the camera, call `$('#reader').html5_qrcode_stop()` to stop scanning for QR codes, close the stream, and relinquish permissions granted by the user.   
(This will result in the "camera on" light on their device turning off)


### Development

To create your own builds, you can use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). 
A gruntfile has been set up to create minified versions of `html5-qrcode.js` and `jsqrcode-combined.js`.
You will need npm (comes with [node](https://nodejs.org/)), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed first.  

Once installed, clone this repo and load the submodules by running: `git submodule init` then `git submodule update`. Then run `npm install` to download the node packages for Grunt.

Now, to build the minified versions just run `grunt` from the project directory in your terminal. If you're doing continuous development, you can run `grunt watch` to continuously watch javascript files in `src\` and automatically build minified versions when they are modified.
